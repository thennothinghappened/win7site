# AeroWin

Project I was working on through 2022 to create some sort of Windows 7-styled desktop environment
in JavaScript. The project originally came from trying to create the Aero styling using CSS, so was
more presentation-oriented initially, with basic "applications" being supported later via dubious
usage of `eval()`, and an inheritance-based Window class system, basic registry and file system,
among some other windows-inspired functionality - though most of which is tucked away in code and
was not made accessible to the GUI.

I've long since moved on from this project, but recently (of 2025) unarchived it to resolve some
issues and make it "presentable" for hosting as a little novelty on my otherwise quite barren
website.
